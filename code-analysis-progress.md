# Code Analysis & Cleanup Progress - Matchpoint Tennis Club

## Project Overview

**Project Path**: `/Users/ricardskrizanovskis/matchpoint-tennis-github`
**Project Type**: Tennis club member portal web application
**Technology Stack**: Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
**Main Purpose**: Schedule management, player booking system, club wall, admin panel

## Analysis Guidelines

### What We're Looking For
- **Unused imports/scripts**: External libraries or files not being used
- **Dead code**: Unreferenced functions, variables, constants
- **Duplicate files**: Multiple versions of similar functionality
- **Orphaned files**: Files with no external references
- **Unused CSS**: Selectors and rules not applied to any elements
- **Console logs and debug code**: Development artifacts left in production

### Safety Protocols
- **NEVER DELETE OR MODIFY CODE** without explicit user confirmation
- Always create backup recommendations before any changes
- Provide detailed impact analysis for each proposed change
- Show exactly what will be removed/modified before taking action
- Implement changes incrementally with testing checkpoints

- **Features**: Login system, schedule management, player booking, admin panel

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Discovery (COMPLETED)
- [x] Mapped project structure
- [x] Identified technology stack  
- [x] Analyzed main entry points
- [x] Created progress tracking system

### ✅ Phase 2: File Analysis (COMPLETED)

**File Usage Analysis Results**:
- [x] script.js (main - 1312 lines) ✅ USED by index.html
- [x] working-script.js (alternate - 592 lines) ✅ USED by index-working.html  
- [x] simple-script.js (simplified - 123 lines) ❌ UNUSED - not referenced anywhere
- [x] firebase-config.js ✅ USED by index.html
- [x] js/confetti.js ✅ USED by index.html
- [x] js/retro-grid.js ❌ POTENTIALLY UNUSED - not referenced in scripts
- [x] styles.css ✅ USED by all HTML files
- [x] HTML files analysis completed

## Initial Observations

### Confirmed Issues Identified

**SAFE TO REMOVE (Conservative Analysis)**:
1. **simple-script.js (123 lines)** - Not referenced by any HTML file
2. **js/retro-grid.js (180 lines)** - Loaded but never used in any script

**DEVELOPMENT/TEST FILES (Needs Confirmation)**:
3. **index-working.html** - Uses working-script.js, appears to be development version
4. **test-login.html** - Contains test login page with inline script
5. **grid-preview.html** - Preview file for grid functionality
6. **confetti-demo.html** - Demo file for confetti effects
7. **CNAME.backup** - Backup configuration file

**FILE RELATIONSHIP MAPPING**:
- **index.html** (PRODUCTION) → script.js, firebase-config.js, js/confetti.js, js/retro-grid.js
- **index-working.html** (DEVELOPMENT) → working-script.js
- **test-login.html** (TEST) → inline JavaScript only

### User Preferences ✅
- **Cleanup Strategy**: CONSERVATIVE (only obvious unused code)
- **Approach**: Preserve anything that might be in use
- **Focus**: Clear unused files, obvious dead code, development artifacts

### ✅ Phase 3: Analysis Report (COMPLETED)
- [x] Generated comprehensive cleanup report: `CLEANUP-REPORT-CONSERVATIVE.md`
- [x] Identified 2 safe-to-remove files (simple-script.js, js/retro-grid.js)
- [x] Identified 5 development/test files for user decision
- [x] Mapped all file relationships and dependencies
- [x] Created implementation checklist with safety protocols

## Next Steps

**AWAITING USER APPROVAL**:
1. **Review CLEANUP-REPORT-CONSERVATIVE.md** - Comprehensive findings
2. **Approve Phase 1 safe deletions** - Zero risk removals
3. **Decide on development files** - Keep or archive test/demo files
2. **Analyze script file relationships** and identify which files are actually used
3. **Scan for unused functions and variables** in active files
4. **Check CSS for unused selectors**
5. **Generate comprehensive cleanup report**
