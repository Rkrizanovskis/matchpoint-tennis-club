# Firebase Migration Context - Matchpoint Tennis Club

## 🔄 RESUME WORK - Quick Start

### To Continue This Migration:
1. **Open this context file**: `/Users/ricardskrizanovskis/matchpoint-tennis-github/FIREBASE_MIGRATION_CONTEXT.md`
2. **Use this prompt**: "I want to continue the Firebase migration for my tennis app. We've completed migrating the players list and schedules to Firebase. Next, we need to migrate the club wall messages. The context is in FIREBASE_MIGRATION_CONTEXT.md"

- ✅ Multiple users see same schedule updates instantly
- ⏳ Club wall messages still using localStorage

### Server Command:
```bash
cd /Users/ricardskrizanovskis/matchpoint-tennis-github && python3 -m http.server 8001
# Access at: http://localhost:8001
# Password: 30:Love
```

### Current Work (August 2025):
- Completed Phase 3: Player migration
- Completed Phase 4: Schedule migration
- Fixed all persistence issues
- Ready for Phase 5: Club wall messages

## 🎯 Migration Overview
Transform the Matchpoint Tennis Club app from localStorage (individual) to Firebase Firestore (shared real-time database) while maintaining the simple, communal approach.

**Project Start Date:** January 2025  
**Current Status:** Planning Phase  
**Working Directory:** `/Users/ricardskrizanovskis/matchpoint-tennis-github/`

## 📋 Requirements Summary

### Authentication & Access
- ✅ Keep single password system (`30:Love`)
- ✅ No individual user accounts
- ✅ All members have equal access (can book, message, manage players)
- ✅ Keep dropdown player selection for bookings

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Real-time sync for ALL features (bookings, messages, player list)
- ✅ Continue hosting on GitHub Pages (matchpoint.lv)
- ✅ Online-only (no offline support needed)
- ✅ Start fresh (no data migration from localStorage)

## 🏗️ Architecture Plan

### Frontend (No Changes)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Domain:** matchpoint.lv
- **Files:** index.html, styles.css, script.js

### Backend (New)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore
- **Real-time:** Firestore listeners
- **Authentication:** Anonymous auth (to enable Firestore access)
- **Security:** Simple rules allowing authenticated users to read/write

## 🔑 Key Code Changes

### Recent Fixes (Phase 4 - Schedules):

1. **Fixed Schedule Persistence** (in `script.js`):
```javascript
// initializeDefaultSchedule() now creates empty structure
// Players array is empty - populated from Firebase
players: [], // Will be populated from Firebase

// Only adds default players on very first run
if (isFirstTime) {
    // Set default players based on day and time
    if (day === 'monday' && timeSlot === '20:00-21:00') {
        session.players = ['richards', 'diana'];
    }
    // ... etc
}
```

2. **Fixed Player ID Issues**:
- Cleaned up duplicate players with timestamp IDs
- Ensured dropdown shows only correct player IDs
- Fixed booking to use existing player IDs, not create new ones

3. **Fixed Player Count Display**:
- Updated Firebase listener to preserve all session fields
- Ensured `maxCapacity` field is maintained (default: 5)

### Key Functions Added:

```javascript
// Schedule-specific functions
initializeScheduleListener() // Real-time listener for current week
saveScheduleToFirebase() // Saves individual sessions
initializeSchedulesInFirebase() // First-time setup with defaults

// Updated booking functions
async function confirmBooking() // Now saves to Firebase
async function handleRemovePlayer() // Updates Firebase
```

## 🛡️ Firebase Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to all authenticated users
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Concurrent Bookings
- Implement transaction for booking slots
- Check slot availability before confirming
- Show real-time updates to prevent double-booking

### Performance
- Limit message history queries
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement debouncing for rapid updates

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Firebase quota limits
- Authentication failures

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Requirements gathering
